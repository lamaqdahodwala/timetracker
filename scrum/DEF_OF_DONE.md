# Definition of done

For future reference, this file will contain a definition of done, indicating all that is required to mark a sprint as completed.

For every sprint, there must be:

1. Sufficient tests that adequately measure the code's functionality and all tasks completed during the sprint
2. Reasoning for design choices, written in a Markdown file inside the `scrum` folder.
3. All tests throughout the repo pass, including the tests written during the sprint
4. Storybook stories are written and completed for front-end components of the sprint.
   - By "completed", it is meant that the stories should document all possible states of the component.
